# Unauthorized-Spore
Some old project I created for fun, With very corny 'responses'.


> [!WARNING]
> This project may contain bugs, I tested most of the stuff out and haven't found any bugs.
> And please, If you find a issue in the program. Let me know.

Command usage example: "observe /core/alpha/root_1/sp01"

Usage: Terminates a root, Might fail. Might succeed.

## Halt_all
Command usage example: "halt_all"
Usage: Attempts to shut the core down, Very **unlikely** for it to happen..

## Reveal

# About
I created this project to practice my python skills, I was into the horror scene and wanted to create this.
The responses I put in there are VERY corny, I'm not the best at horror honestly.

> What the program is based off
Multiple roots inside of a core. Each root contains spores on them that have different statuses, (eg. watching, latent, ruptured, etc)
It's a terminal for controlling the core. Although for some reason you have access to it now.
